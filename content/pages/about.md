## My name is Spid3r
Hey, I'm **sondt**, also known as **nosiaht**. I work in (IoT) security research, and I enjoy CTFs focused on `Reverse Engineering`, `Binary Exploitation`, and `Digital Forensics`.

## About this site

I’ll use this site to share writeups of CTFs or post articles related to **cybersecurity**.
